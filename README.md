# spotify-launcher

Spotify has a free linux client but prohibits re-distribution, so this is a freely distributable opensource program that manages a spotify installation in your home folder from the official spotify release server.

If you work for spotify please reach out so we can talk. ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ
